## User Policy

FIWARE Lab will implement user policies at its own discretion in favour of a rational use of the resources. We reserve the right to establish quotas, restrictions of any kind and time limits. These may be implemented by means of user profiles or alternative methods. The initial setting will be as follows but it can change over time to adapt to changing needs of the FIWARE ecosystem and the available capacity.

The main policies are summarized as follow:

1. Users are categorized in "Trial" and "Community". Trial users include the users accessing the Lab for testing the FIWARE technologies during a limited period of time. Community users include users who have formally requested a longer-term environment for working on the development of applications based on FIWARE technologies.
1. Trial users will be provided with a limited set of resources and for a limited period of time (14 days) within a single node part of FIWARE Lab. To keep resources, Trial users who wish to have a longer-term environment will need to apply (and obtain) a Community account (see point 3 below). After the expiration of their trial period, the account assigned to a Trial user is disabled and the associated resources released - any backup is up to the user. FIWARE Lab is not responsible for the loss of any data. Reminders are sent one week before the expiration day as well as the day before. The total resources made available to Trial Users are documented at the [[Reources_Available_to_Trial_users|Reources Available to Trial users]] page. However, the amount of resources assigned to Trial Users may vary depending on availability of new nodes and changes in internal policies.
1. Community users will be selected through an application process. The application process, which may result with a negative answer, will be handled with the eventual support of FIWARE Accelerator projects (see https://www.fiware.org/fiware-accelerator-programme/) that will identify users that are part of their acceleration programme. Users beyond the FIWARE Accelerator programme are also admitted. Users willing to become Community users will need to describe the application they are developing and the planned usage of FIWARE resources. Community users will be assigned a default FIWARE Lab node and will have access to it for a 9-month period unless the application process is renewed. This node is selected according to their preference and/or ascription to a given FIWARE accelerator project, each of which is linked to a default node. By issuing a request for additional resources, Community users may be able to access additional nodes if well motivated.
1. If the total quota assigned to Trial users gets exhausted, requests to create a Trial user account that require management of cloud resources will be queued and notified once resources are available on a "first come, first served" basis.
1. Users requesting a Public IP need to provide a verifiable identity information that will be handled by FIWARE infrastructure providers to ensure the possibly to track liable actions within the FIWARE Lab.
1. Users will not be able to create new "Organizations" anymore beyond the organization linked to their account. FIWARE Lab allows to share access to the cloud environment set up by a given user by adding users to the organization linked to that user. As a consequence, existing organizations will be blocked from accessing cloud resources.
