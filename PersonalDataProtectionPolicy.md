# Personal Data Protection Policy

This is the main privacy policy for fiware.org and for certain services provided through these and other FIWARE websites and applications (“Our Sites”) by FIWARE Foundation e.V. (“FIWARE”).

At FIWARE we collect different types of information about our users for three main reasons:
1. To provide personalised services unique to individual users
1. To help us to monitor and improve the services we offer
1. To market services, always in scope of the FIWARE Foundation mission, to the users we have permission for.

There may be other privacy policies that apply to certain services we provide. Please read these when you register or subscribe for these services on those specific sites.

## Our principles

1. FIWARE adopts the necessary technical and organisational measures to avoid the loss, misuse, alteration, unauthorised access, or theft of the personal data received, taking into account the state of technology, the nature of the data, and the risks to which they are exposed. This means:
   1. we make sure that we have in place appropriate security measures to protect your information; and
   1. we make sure that when we ask another organisation to provide a service for us, they have in place appropriate security measures as well.  

1. To respect your privacy is topmost of our concerns. You should receive marketing emails only from us and, if you agree, from other organisations we have carefully chosen following the current European and German legislation. We will make sure it is clear when you can make these choices. However, we may email you occasionally with information or questions about your registration, your subscription account, or postings, for example, with reminders, warnings, business opportunities, or copyright requests.

1. We will collect and use individual user details only if we have explicit permission to do so, or we have sensible business reasons for doing so, such as collecting enough information to manage subscriptions.

1. We will be clear in our dealings with you as to what information about you we will collect and how we will use it.

1. We will use personal information only for the purposes for which it was originally collected, how they are defined at the beginning of this document, and we will make sure we delete it securely.

1. Our Site is accessible via the internet. This means that people around the World who access our website can see anything you post on the website or twitter comments with the FIWARE hash.

1. If we or our service providers transfer any information out of the European Union (EU), it will only be done with the relevant protection (stated under European and German law) being in place.   

The information that it is collected from you consist on:
* when you register or become a member of our portals 
* when you use the website 
* through cookies.

Certain services that we provide may involve us collecting extra information (Membership, for example or subscription detail to the FIWARE Newsletter), such as where you are, therefore the service can be provided as designed. Please also note our [http://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/Cookies_Policy_FIWARE Cookies-Policy].

## Registration
 
The minimum information we need to register you is your name, email address, and a password. We might ask you more information for different services, including newsletter subscription. Unless we say otherwise, you have to provide all the registration information needed for the specific service.

All responsibility for the completion of forms with false, inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated information shall vest on the Users.

To assist us in our marketing, in addition to the data that you provide to us upon your registration, we may also obtain data from trusted third parties to help us to understand what you might be interested in. This ‘profiling’ information is obtained from a variety of sources, including publicly available data, or from sources such as surveys and polls where you have given your permission for your data to be shared. You can choose not to have such data shared with the FIWARE just informing us about it.

After you have registered, and with your permission, we may send you emails we think may be of interest of you. At any time, you can decide not to receive these emails and will be able to ‘unsubscribe’.

'''Is the provision of personal data obligatory?'''

If you have a business relationship with us, apply for Membership, send us a query or use our online services, you must provide the personal data necessary for performing that business function or service, and for fulfilling all associated contractual obligations or where we are subject to the legal obligation to collect such data. As a rule, without this data we are obliged to reject the order or conclusion of the contract, or cannot continue to carry out an existing contract and may need to end such contract.

'''How long do we keep your data?'''

We process and store your personal data as long as it is necessary to fulfil our contractual and legal obligations, or to fulfil legitimate interests. When this data is no longer necessary for the above purposes, it will be regularly deleted, except where - limited - data retention periods are required by commercial and tax laws such as the German Commercial Code and the German Fiscal Code. The retention periods specified in the above-mentioned Codes is six to ten years.

## Who we share data with
We will not share your personal information with others for marketing purposes unless you have given us your permission. If we have your permission, we will share your information only with other organizations we have chosen carefully.

We can access and release personal information to keep to relevant laws and government requests, to operate our systems properly and to protect both us and our users.

Any other organizations who accesses your information in the course of providing services on our behalf will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure that they protect your information and keep to data-protection and privacy laws which apply. We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards. We may use service providers to help us run these sites (or services available on the sites), some of which may be based outside the EU.
